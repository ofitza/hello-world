# hello-world
Just a simple repository

Greetings!


	I have been highly interested in everything design for over 20 years. I have been self studying and practicing graphic design every chance I had – I was a proud owner of the Bondi Blue iMac G3 when it first came out in 1998 – a computer that I saved up for just to use for my designs.
While raising and homeschooling my four children (two of which are special needs), keeping up with Adobe Certifications was put on the backburner, since I no longer had the time or the funds for all of the certification tests. I still designed on my own time, practicing and perfecting my skills while keeping up with all of the new platforms.

	Now that my children are older, I can finally aim for what I have wanted all of these years – a career in Graphic Design. I have enrolled in school to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design, and am ecstatic that I can again focus on designing. 

	My whole family is very active in our church, and one of the biggest tasks I have had was to redesign and maintain our church’s Diocesan website, while keeping it in a style that is approved by the Diocesan board. This task not only gave me more practice in functional design, SEO, and the like, but also got me hooked on WordPress. Because of this experience, I am a very proficient and eager WordPress designer – I love to take my ideas and custom designs, and integrate them with WordPress to make beautiful, responsive websites.

	I can bring all of my many different life experiences to the table. Be it an old school design, something more contemporary, or a harmonious mix of both, I can adequately customize clients’ needs, and produce clean, functional, and elegant designs, delivering exceptional results.

	I am a great team player, and tend to grasp difficult problems very quickly and work out solutions expeditiously. Most importantly, I enjoy what I do, and always have a positive attitude.
